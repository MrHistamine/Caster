Caster - A Plex Plug-in
==========================================

Caster is a channel for the Plex Media Server & Center suite of software programs.  This channel allows you to create casters (reall just channels) that launch external applications.

Installation
==========================================
NOTE:  For directions containing illustrations, download the "Caster_Installation_Instructions.pdf", under the "Documentation" folder.

1. On the computer system running Plex Media Server (PMS), right-click on its
tray icon, and select "Open Plug-ins Folder".
2. Copy the "Caster.bundle" folder, to PMS's plug-in folder.
3. After a bit, the plug-in should show up in the PMS's Media Manager
(right-click the PMS tray icon, and select "Media Manager..."; if you already have
it open, refresh the browser).  If it doesn't appear after a few minutes, restart
PMS (right-click the PMS tray icon, select Exit then, re-launch the PMS
application).

How To Use Caster
==========================================
NOTE:  See the document labeled "How_to_Cast_an_External_Program.pdf" under the "Documentation" folder, for an example of how to create casters (really just Plex channels).
